We, Trice Buchanan and Roan Angerer are from team PS14. We are both Sophomores
Majoring in Computer Science at Iowa State University. We are in the process of learning
many demanding web development skills through our mutual class, SE 3190. Some
examples of such skills are the basics: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as more modern
development tools: React, NodeJS, and MySQL. From our in-class activities and
assignments we have learned how to build, design, and style various websites. We are
also both skilled at project management through participation in SE 1860, a project-based
class in which a product is developed from conception to completion. We believe that we
can combine our thoughts and skills to make a functional, useful, and elegant website.

We are aiming to rebuild and make additions to our previous website, which served as
both an inspiring and practical hub for travel enthusiasts. Through our platform, Epic
Escapes Travel Company, we will showcase the world’s most breathtaking destinations
and hidden gems. We believe that travel has the power to transform lives, opening
minds to new cultures and experiences. Our interactive website will allow users to
explore, plan, and immerse themselves in unforgettable journeys. As for new features,
users will be able to create accounts and post on the Epic Escapes message boards,
letting other users know what incredible journeys they’ve been on.
